          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi there! My name is Joel Alex and I am a 2018 BCA graduate with a diverse professional background. I started my career at Infosys where I worked for almost 2 years, starting as a testing executive and later transitioning to a senior testing executive role. During my time there, I gained experience in both manual and automation software testing, using tools such as SQL, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Selenium, and UFT. I also used the Jira tool for managing user stories, test cases, and defects, and carried out automation in .NET using Selenium and C#.</p>
          <p>After that, I decided to switch my career to digital marketing and worked as a Digital Support Executive at Thirdwave Overseas Education for about 1 year and 6 months. My role involved digital designing and marketing, ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google, lead generation, designing posters, SEO off-page, link building, and blogging. I am proficient in digital marketing and digital designing, with experience in SMM, SEM, SEO, Google Analytics, CRM software, Google Ads, and Microsoft Office tools such as Excel.</p>
          <p>Later, I joined HashRoot as a Digital Marketing Lead for 6 months. During my time there, I was responsible for social media handling, content creation, blogging, SEO off-page and on-page, and link building. I have experience in conducting both on-page and off-page SEO activities for four different brands and have created social media strategies for six different brands. I used various tools such as Excel, Canva, ChatGPT, and Ubersuggest.</p>
          <p>My skills include attention to detail, adaptability and flexibility, teamwork and collaboration, customer service, organization skills, and basic financial analysis. As a dedicated, open-minded, and versatile professional, I am eager to secure an Associate/Analyst role where I can apply my skills and contribute to the growth of the organization. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile summary.</p>
